Generate RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 or ATOM formatted feeds
====================================================

This package can be used to generate feeds in either RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 or ATOM
format.

Applications can create a feed object, several feed item objects, set
several types of properties of either feed and feed items, and add items to
the feed.

Once a feed is fully composed with its items, the feed class can generate
the necessary XML structure to describe the feed in RSS or ATOM format. This
structure can be directly sent to the browser, or just returned as string.
